### Folder structure

```bash
├── P1C
│   ├── res
│   │   └── P1C
│   │       └── counts.txt
│   └── s_P1C.sh
```

Each sample folder has the same structure. The counts.txt file contains the RNA-seq count data and the .sh file contains the commands issued to the cluster for the mapping / counting / QC pipline.

The notebook FiguresPaper.ipynb can be open/run with the Binder badge and contains the code to reproduce the figures of the paper.
